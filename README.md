**This software is in beta phase and should not be integrated in any production environment. If you tested it and want to give feedback, please open an issue. Thank You!**
Nextcloud OCR (optical character recoginition) processing for images and PDF with tesseract-ocr and OCRmyPDF brings OCR capability to your Nextcloud 10.
The app uses tesseract-ocr, OCRmyPDF and a php internal message queueing service in order to process images (png, jpeg, tiff) and PDF (currently not all PDF-types are supported, for more information see [here](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF)) asynchronously and save the output file to the same folder in nextcloud, so you are able to search in it.
The source data won&#39;t get lost. Instead:
 - in case of a PDF a copy will be saved with an extra layer of the processed text, so that you are able to search in it.
 - in case of a image the result of the OCR processing will be saved in a .txt file next to the image (same folder). 

**One big feature is the asynchronous ocr processing brought by the internal php message queueing system (Semaphore functions), which supports workers to handle tasks asynchronous from the rest of nextcloud.**

## Prerequisites, Requirements and Dependencies
The OCR app has some prerequisites:
 - **[Nextcloud 10](https://nextcloud.com/)** or higher
 - **Linux** server as environment. (tested with Debian 8, Raspbian and Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty))
 - **[OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF)** &gt;v2.x (tested with v4.1.3 (v4 is recommended))
 - **[tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)** &gt;v3.02.02 with corresponding language files (e.g. tesseract-ocr-eng)

For further information see the [homepage](http://janis91.github.io/ocr/) or the appropriate documentation in the wiki.

*Hint: OCRmyPDF and tesseract have to be globally available in command-line, so that the server user (eg. www-data, nginx, apache) can execute the commands (eg. tesseract or ocrmypdf).*

## Installation
Install the app from the [Nextcloud AppStore](http://apps.nextcloud.com) or download/clone the git repository and place the content in **nextcloud/apps/ocr/**.
Please remind, that the app will not work as expected or maybe cannot be even installed as long as the prior mentioned Dependencies are not available.

## Administration
Please read the related topics in the [wiki](https://github.com/janis91/ocr/wiki).

## Usage
The app integrates within the standard _files_ app of Nextcloud.

In the Nextcloud file list the OCR action is registered as a fileaction like the _delete_ or _download_ action.

Please consider, that sometimes after uploading the site has to be refreshed before processing of the newly uploaded files will work (_Exception: "Wrong path parameter."_).

**Depending on the filesize, especially when processing a pdf, the ocr process is a long running process (tested with 120KB -> 10s). It is absolutely recommended to do nothing with the files which are processed in nextcloud until processing finishes.**
